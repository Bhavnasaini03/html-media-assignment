    <!-- p is a paragraph tag which adds some text. -->
    <p>Diwali, or Dipawali, is India 's biggest and most important<br>
       holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the<br>
       row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light <br>
       outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that <br>
       protects from spiritual darkness. </p>

    <h2> Festival Of Lights </h2><hr>
    <p>Widely observed among more than a billion people from a<br>
        variety of faiths across India and its diaspora, the five<br>
         days of Diwali are marked by prayer, feasts, fireworks, family <br>
         gatherings, and charitable giving. For some, Diwali is also <br>
         the beginning of a new year. But Diwali is perhaps best known<br>
          as a festival of lights.</p>
